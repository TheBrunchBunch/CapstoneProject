So we can start with an empty \"chart\" tab: ChartChooseris a list of buttons encapsulated in a component: We also need the chart module setup from the Vue sample (it won’t work in a<script type=\"text/babel\">): Chart.js isn’t shipped in a form you can import into a Babel script.",

But we get that content from the server so we can put our trust in the XSS protection there and ignore the warning.

One problem with Webjars for some people is the size of the jars - the Bootstrap jar is nearly 2MB, most of which will never be used at runtime - and Javascript tooling has a strong focus on reducing that overhead, by not packaging the whole NPM module in your app, and also by bundling assets together so they can be downloaded efficiently. There are also some issues with Java tooling - regardingSassin particular there is a lack of good tooling, as we found with thePetclinic recently. So maybe we should take a look at options for building with a Node.js toolchain. The first thing you will need is Node.js. There are many ways of obtaining it, and you can use whatever tools you want.",

This isrollup.config.js: So if we move all the Javascript intosrc/main/js/index.jswe would have just one<script>inindex.html, for instance at the end of the<body>: We will keep the CSS for now, and we can deal with a local build for that later. So inindex.jswe have all the<script>tag contents mushed together (or we could have split it up into modules and imported them): If we build and run the app it should all work, and Rollup creates a newindex.jsintarget/classes/staticwhere it will be picked up by the executable JAR.",

We can see how that works by building the CSS for our application, even if we don’t do much customization. Start with some tooling dependencies in NPM: This means we can update ourrollup.config.jsto use the new tools: The CSS processors look in the same place as the main input file, so we can just create astyle.scssinsrc/main/jsand import the Bootstrap code: Customizations in SCSS would follow that if we were doing it for real.",

We have oneindex.jsscript driving all the Javascript and CSS for our Turbo sample, and we can now remove all remaining Webjars dependencies in thepom.xml. To finish up we can apply the same ideas to thereact-webjarssample, removing Webjars and extracting Javascript and CSS into separate source files.

As the use of CAD software has become more prevalent throughout the toy industry, the shapes of the plastic parts have become more complex. For example, toys that transform from one shape to another by moving components into different positions have very complex shapes. As parts become more complex, access to the fasteners themselves becomes more challenging.

Smaller screws are often more difficult to automate, as the clearance area around smaller screws is usually more restrictive, leading to problems with access on automated systems.

    "text": "PostedJune 7, 2017byCharles Morris&filed underNewswire,The Vehicles. It’s not unheard-of for financial analysts to tear down a vehicle to get an accurate estimate of what it costs to produce. Back in 2015, a consulting firmtook apart and reverse-engineered a BMW i3. More recently, a team from UBS disassembled a Chevy Bolt and published a cost analysis of the new EV. However, its report went much further, making some bold predictions about the future of the auto industry. UBS’s main goal was to estimate GM’s cost to build the $37,000 vehicle. It concluded that the Bolt’s electric powertrain is $4,600 cheaper to produce than previously estimated, “with much cost reduction potential left.” However, GM is losing money on the Bolt.",

  {
    "text": "“We estimate that GM loses $7,400 in earnings before interest and tax on every Bolt sold today, mainly due to a lack of scale,” wrote the UBS team. This figure is a little under what other industry observers have estimated. As Elon Musk and others have explained, through the tortuous math of California’s ZEV program, GM earns credits that offset its losses on sales of the Bolt, buthas no incentive to sell more than about 30,000 units per year. However, UBS’s findings imply that, if GM could squeeze out some costs and increase the scale of production, it could be earning a profit on the Bolt before long. UBS extrapolated its findings about Bolt production costs to make a bold prophecy: EVs will prove to be “the most disruptive car category since the Model T Ford.”",

    "text": "The company predicts that “total cost of consumer ownership can reach parity with combustion engines from 2018.” EVs will still carry higher sticker prices, but when the savings on fuel and maintenance are considered, they will be cheaper. UBS expects this price parity to be reached first in Europe, where gas prices are higher, and in the US several years later. “This will create an inflexion point for demand,” said the UBS analysts, with typically Swiss understatement. Once true price parity is breached, a tidal wave of disruption could sweep the industry. UBS has raised its forecast for EV sales in 2025 to 14.2 million – 14% of global car sales. It also predicts that automakers will start earning a profit of about 5% on EVs by 2023, equivalent to today’s average profit margin.",

    "text": "UBS notes that the effects will be felt in related industries as well. It predicts a boom in battery materials such as lithium, cobalt and rare earths. Growing demand will lead to higher prices, spurring “transformative industry growth.” No, there’s not going to bea catastrophic shortage of lithium. According to UBS, “Only cobalt faces the issue of limited reserves, whereas for the other materials, current production capacity is the only bottleneck.” Good news for mineral producers, bad news for makers of replacement parts. “Our detailed analysis of moving and wearing parts has shown that the highly lucrative spare parts business should shrink by 60% in the end-game of a 100% EV world, which is decades away,” UBS said (without explaining why the transition will take decades).",

    "text": "The UBS report moves on to riskier ground when it extrapolates its cost analysis of Chevrolet’s apple to a Tesla orange, the upcoming Model 3. The two companies couldn’t be more different. Giant GM plans to produce the Bolt in low volume, and it can write off any losses as the cost of satisfying government regulators and buying some green cred. Upstart Tesla, on the other hand, hopes to produce Model 3 in quantities of 500,000 per year for starters, and it has more or less staked its existence on being able to do so.",

  {
    "text": "Furthermore, asElectrekpoints out, most of the Bolt, including the battery cells and all the main powertrain components, comes from Korean supplier LG, whereas Tesla has become wary of relying on suppliers, and has vertically integrated the manufacturing of almost its entire powertrain – even the battery cells are produced by Panasonic at the Gigafactory, under the watchful eye of Big Brother Elon. Be that as it may, UBS is confident that what it learned from the Bolt enables it to predict the profitability of Model 3. “We estimate that Tesla will require an achieved selling price of ~$41k for the upcoming Model 3 to break even. This is ~$6k above the estimated base price of $35k.",
    "url": "https://chargedevs.com/newswire/teardown-of-chevy-bolt-points-to-massive-disruption-ahead/"
  },
  {
    "text": "As Tesla buyers are likely to order well-equipped versions (margins on the options should be ~50%), the required ~$41k threshold is likely to be well exceeded, in our view.” In other words, Model 3 will only be profitable if buyers spring for $6,000 worth of options, but most are likely to do so. Unsurprisingly, Tesla is more optimistic – it has been predicting a 20% gross margin on an average sale price of $42,000. Of course, the unstated assumption is that Tesla will meet its ambitious production goals of 500,000 vehicles per year by 2018 and 1 million by 2020. The company is counting on economies of scale and improvements in the manufacturing process to bring costs down. If the ramp-up runs into problems, predictions about profit margins could be out the window.",

These methods contain both simple options, and some that use luxurious tools such as an impact gun or welder. Use caution, as some of the methods described can cause damage to your parts and might injure you if you do not take proper safety precaution (read: don’t be stupid). Try a 6-point wrench or socket on your seized nut/bolt. Start by rocking the bolt by tightening then loosing, this may be all you need to break through the rust. Try and avoid 12-point wrenches and sockets as they likely to slip and strip the bolt head. Another great tool I have found that is made by Irwin Tools is there Original Locking Wrench.",

They have a parrot beak shaped jaw allowing 3 sides of contact without marring up the corners of a hex fastener! Neat, Isn't it?? If using some muscle on the bolt does not allow it to budge don’t be discouraged, as there's a few more ways to get that bolt free. Take a wire brush and clean the bolt of loose rust and dirt. We will then use some PB Blaster or similar PENETRATING OIL (I can vouch for its effectiveness).",

Now let’s try out the 6-point socket/wrench again, you may find that it now loosens easier but it may still bind. Again, rock it in and out to break that binding force. Our next step is to use leverage to remove that stubborn bolt. Beware, rusted bolts and cheaper tools could possibly break and really screw you over. The best way to get some leverage is by using what is called a Breaker Bar, a long handled socket wrench without a ratchet mechanism.",

However, the wrong tool for the job could hurt you. I suggest you do it right and buy a breaker bar. Beware, at this point if your bolt is beginning to feel \"soft\" it may be twisting and about to break. At this point, the bolt may still not budge. I bet your getting frustrated, Right? Don’t fear, there’s still plenty more things to try! Our next step is to use a torch to heat the bolt up. The idea is to have one side of our bolt expand from the heat and break the rust.",

Remove the heat and let cool or pour warm water on the bolt to speed up cooling. Once it is cool, try out the breaker bar again. With any luck, The heat has broken the rust seal on the bolt allowing it to turn. This is not a good idea around flammables or rubber gaskets/bushings. Since we have the propane torch out, we can also add candle wax to the stuck bolt threads. Apply a paraffin candle to the cool side of the nut, this will allow the paraffin (a lubricating wax) to be drawn toward the heat through the threads allowing you to unscrew the nut hopefully.",

Try a 50/50 Mix of Automatic Transmission Fluid with Acetone; it works exceptionally well. Treat several time over an hour and try to loosen again with the breaker bar. If you have been unable to free the bolt by now, we'll have to take drastic measures. If we are working with a bolt, We will have to drill out our bolt and retap the threads for a new bolt. This involves picking a drill bit the size of the hole, boring straight in and removing the threads of the bolt. Then, you will need to screw in a tapping tool to recreate our threads.",

    "text": "If you need the exact size hole, bore the bolt out oversized and buy a heli coil. This threads into a tapped hole with an inner diameter for the correct bolt you would like. If you have good access to the bolt another option could be to use a nut splitter. These inexpensive gadgets are found at most at most auto parts stores - I paid $10 for mine. A nut splitter is slipped over the seized nut, then a screw on the side of the splitter is tightened which forced a wedge into the side of the nut. Keep cranking the nut splitter screw until the nut makes an audible pop and you get through the nut. Back off the nut splitter screw and clean the bolt of the split nut.",

With the nut removed, the bolt should be much easier to remove. Unfortunately, this method destroys the nut and every once in a while the bolt too depending on its condition. Our last step if the nut splitter doesn’t work (or appeal to your stubborn bolt scenario) is use an angle grinder to cut the head off the bolt. Simply grind the nut and bolt until the nut no longer exists and pull the bolt right out. This works great just be very careful as angle grinders can be a dangerous tool, they spin exceptionally fast (8000+ RPM) and have no anti kick mechanism. If your are not careful, the grinding disc may shatter and fly apart in all directions.",

You just broke off the head of the bolt you were trying to extract, leaving you with a stuck bolt and no way to remove it. Luckily there's one last way before drilling and retapping. Go to an auto parts store and look for a Bolt Extractor, it’s a nifty tool that screws in the same direction as the bolt unscrews and allows you to drill into stuck bolt and keep turning it tighter and tighter until the bolt comes free and out. My bolt extractor kit came with a reverse-threaded drill bit, allowing you to drill into the bolt and then back the bolt out using the bolt extractor. It's a GREAT TOOL and will save a lot of headaches This a relatively new method I have learned from a friend of mine!",

    "text": "I wanted to add this to the list. A great way to remove a stubborn bolt is to \"shock\" it loose. When I say shock it loose, I mean hammer it! To be more precise, an Air Hammer. Using an air hammer on low pressure will make a nice vibrating but strong tool enough to loosen rust sometimes. Believe me, It works. If you tune the air pressure correctly, It will have a distinct hum. On the other end of this spectrum, if the first doesnt work, is to use a blunt or pointed tip on the head of a bolt with full PSI to the tool. This rapidly hammers it breaking the rust up mechanically. Even greater when penetrating oil has been applied. I have found this works very, very well. To my recent discovery, There is actually a brake bleeder tool made by Phoenix Systems called a Bleeder Buster.",

Another option for removing a rusty and stripped bolt? You can always repair the hex portion of the faster! How? Its simple! A great way to do this is to add a new nut to the old bolt head! A great way to do this, is to use a wire brush to clean the head of the bolt. Pretty clean is acceptable. From here, An appropriate sized nut can be MIG/Wire Feed welded on top of the bolt to provide a new gripping surface for the wrench onto the bolt! Nifty eh? Well, Guess what! This heating to cherry read while welding is also a great heat shock to the corrosion holding the fastener on! This makes it easier to remove!",

However, They tend to occasionally snap rusty bolts off unfortunately. Use with care, Especially if you have a powerful one! There is not much to them, Simply put them on a rusty nut and depress the trigger and let the tool hammer away!

Coiled Spring Pins: Coiled Spring Pins, also known as Spiral Pins or Coiled Pins, are headless, hollow pins with chamfered ends, made by shaping or wrapping a steel sheet into a slightly larger diameter than the standard size. Unlike the slotted pins variety, these pins are distinguished by their multiple walls. Uses:These pins are frequently used to join and fasten two or more components together. When the pins are inserted into pre-drilled holes, their spiral shape allows them to expand and exert radial pressure against the sides of the hole. This creates a secure and snug fit/connection.",

Stainless steel Spring Pins are commonly used in electronics and food industries. Hair/Hitch Pin Clips: Hitch Pin Clips, also known as Hair Pin Clips, Bridge Pins or R-Clips, are double-bodied pins formed from round wires.

Watchmakers will have their own preferences of what type of oilers to use but you really just need a simple oiler to get the job done. In skilled hands, simple oilers can get the job done for anything. This is a Precision Tip oiler. Pay particular attention to the tip of the nib. Notice how it's curved and shaped to grab a specific and exact amount. If you have the money, these are awesome. I personally like these a lot. It's not necessary but it definitely gives you a consistent and correct amount of oil each time. These come in a variety of sizes for different jobs.",

Great for repetitive work where you know the specific amount of oil you need over and over again. Automatic oilers are great if you're working on the same movement repeatedly. We're able to dispense a specific amount of oil each time we use it. You'll commonly see these in manufacturers where the watchmakers are working on the same set of calibers over and over again. If you're working at the retail level or in a shop where all types of movements come through your hands, I would highly recommend you set the quantity to the movement that comes through most frequently.",

At the end of the day- automatic oilers are used to save time and speed up work efficiency. You should still know how to do oiling by hand. Watchmaking lubricants used to be purely animal and vegetable oil. This is also the reason why older watches may smell like fish when you open it up. Watchmakers used to use sperm oil from sperm whales as a lubricant. It worked really well (considering the technology at the time) except the fact that it would gum up within several months. It's a good thing and a bad thing. It's bad in the sense that the watch would literally stop running within several months because the oil would gum up into an extremely thick substance.",

    "text": "It's a good thing because the watch would be well preserved with little to no wear on the pivots. Today's synthetic oils are the complete opposite. Since it's synthetic, it doesn't gum up at all. Watches can run well past the life span of synthetic oils. When we use animal/vegetable oil, the lubricant eventually gums up due to natural occurring substances. On the other hand, synthetic oil literally dries up and evaporates. This leaves the pivots running dry on the jewels which will cause added friction and wear on the pivots. Added friction and wear on the pivots will eventually cause metal sheering and gunk to build up (one of the reasons why overhaul is recommended after several years). There are many types of lubrications and each brand will categorize them differently.",

Commonly used for: Balance cap jewels, escape wheel, and seconds wheel. HP 1000 or HP 1300 -(Fun fact, HP stands for High Pressure) Heavy synthetic oils. Generally used for high pressure/torque and low speed areas. Commonly used for: Barrel arbors, center wheel, and third wheel. Some brands will also use this for the setting system and calendar mechanisms. There are differences between HP 1000 and HP 1300 (such as viscosity etc.) but we’ll go into that another time. MOEBIUS D5-Older version before HP1000 was introduced. Watchmakers used to MOEBIUS D5 before HP1000 was introduced.",

MOEBIUS 9415-Generally only used for pallet jewels/stones. The thick substance holds it's own for high speed contact. Watchmakers use this specific oil for the escapement while other brands such as Rolex may use RL2 MOLYKOTE DX- Greasy paste normally used for setting systems and other high friction areas. Lots of brands for a LONG period of time have used Molykote for their setting systems because of reliability. Molykote wasn't even originally designed for watchmaking use!

It's used as a breaking grease. It's very thick. It's high viscosity makes it a great choice in the barrel. We'll usually lace this lightly around the sides of the barrel walls. Make sure that you're careful when using this. Do not get it on the top/bottom lids of the barrel. MOEBIUS 8200-We'll use 8200 for mainsprings (some use it on the setting system for older watches). Generally, we'll clean mainsprings with Solvent H. After which, we'll run a small amount of 8200 onto the entire length of the mainspring itself. 8200 has been a staple in many technical guides.",

FIXODROP EPILAME- Although not an oil or lubricant, I couldn't talk about oils without mentioning Epilame. The most basic explanation of Epilame is that it's used to change the surface tension on a part so that oil doesn't run off or spread. Some common parts we'll use Epilame on are the escape wheel, pallet fork jewels/stones, tip of the seconds wheel, cap jewels, and reverser wheels. Take a look at that escape wheel. This is a good close up magnification on a ladies caliber. Do you see that drop of oil that’s literally hanging on from the escape wheel tooth? This my friends is the perfect explanation of Epilame.",

Epilame alters the surface tension of whatever you’re applying it to so that oil will likely remain in place. We’ll want to use Epilame because modern watches are running at such high speeds that oil is likely to either flick away or spread around. Take a look at the link in my bio for more info. We use epilame on common parts with extremely high transitional force such as the escape wheel and pallet fork jewels. We will also use it on the second wheel pivot at the end and balance cap jewels. At the manufacture level, they will have epilame’d a good majority of the movement. Outside of that, the movement does not require another epilame treatment. ______",

There’s different methods of curing it. All of which are valid and you will have to figure it out. _______ Fun fact: did you know only a small fraction of an Epilame bottle contains the active ingredient? I’m talking about roughly .007 percent. That means the whole bottle is primarily solution and is used as a transfer agent. That’s a great business if you ask me.

This is your average and common jewel on a gear train that we will oil. This should serve as a GUIDELINE and reference only. There is no steadfast rule that is set in stone but there are RECOMMENDED procedures. Of course there are clearly some binary things we do and do not want to do. You always want oil in the cup, not on top of the cup. It should not be anywhere else other then inside the cup where the pivot is. Any oil anywhere outside of the cup will cause oil to spread and or attract unwanted build up. Oil containers and the surroundings of it should always be kept cleaned.",

You should be opening it to grab the oil with your oiler and closing itimmediately. Again, it’s worth repeating. The oil lid should only be open to grab the oil and closed right afterwards. Do not grab the oil, proceed to oil the part, and then close the oil lid when you’re done. This is how oils get contaminated quickly. Always swab the oil with the oiler at the surrounding edge of the oil cup. Do not get oil from the deep deposit in the middle. This is because dirt, dust, and other contiminants will usually make it’s way to the deep deposit in the middle of the oil cup. Try not to scrape the oil pot.",

Consistent renewal of small quantities of oil is ALWAYS better than inconsistent replenishment of a large amounts of oil. Change out your oils weekly. Yes. Weekly. Do not skip this step. When changing oils, use something like Solvent H to clean the oil pot. Do not just simply wipe it with paper. When getting oil from the actual bottle- make sure you do not contaminate it. You have no idea how many watchmakers I’ve seen with contaminated bottles that still had 9/10 of the bottle to go. Check the expiration date. The shelf life of a lubricant will make a difference. You might not think it will but in the long run, it does. The type of oilers you use should not make that big of a difference.",

You can install rivets by drilling or punching a hole in the job material. Next, place the rivet and deform the tail. The simplest way is to bore a hole in the material of the components to connect, because it’s quicker and easier to accomplish. To get the desired fastening, the diameter of the drilled hole should be about 1.5 times larger than the rivet diameter. After insertion, the tail emerges from the opposite end, and you can twist it. When you hammer or apply force to the flat side of the tail, the material flattens to about 1½ times its original size.",

Let’s explore some of the common types of rivets, specifically designed for certain applications. Pop joints are familiar blind rivets. A shank and stem are used when accessing the rear side is difficult. To install, insert the shank into a pre-drilled hole and use a rivet gun to pull the stem. This action distorts the shank and holds the materials in place. When you apply a predefined force, the stem breaks with a sound that resembles a ‘pop’. There are various types of holes, such as open-end, closed-end, countersunk, and so on. They are among the oldest types, commonly used in shipbuilding and coastal bridges.

They resemble solid ones but feature a hole through the shaft. They need less force to install than other types of locks. It makes them simpler to operate. The only part that flares out is the walls at the joint. Engineers commonly use tubular rivets in HVAC ducting because they typically feature a lighter construction. Blind rivets entail a small shank with a projection. When inserted into a drilled hole, the projection is struck with a hammer.",

They feature sawed bodies, making them suitable for home repairs. These eliminate the need for pre-drilling. They pierce material layers and interlock securely, making them suitable for high-stress applications and dissimilar materials.

There are slower cure adhesives (such as Permabond UV612) which allow a longer clean up time with the adhesive part-cured as an easy to slice off gel.",

You may consider the guidelines provided here for other types of adhesive such as MS-Polymers, hybrid products, and polyurethanes, but of course, refer to the appropriate safety datasheet. In every case, removing adhesive outside of the joint (such as the meniscus or “fillet”) can be slightly detrimental to the bond strength and long term durability. It does help to protect the joint against moisture ingress and helps prevent crack propagation from peel stresses. So if the appearance allows, leave and cure the excess.

Dowel pins (and pin-slot arrangements) are often the go-to for precision alignment. However, one side of the dowel connection requires a slip/clearance fit while the other side requires a press fit. Due to the potential clearance in the slip fit this setup might not be as accurate as using another method. The method I use most frequently is just using the outside surface of a circular part to fit into a large hole on the other part. However, this is usually a sliding fit or even a locational clearance fit, where the potential clearance could allow the parts to sit off-centre.",

In product design, snap-fits come in various shapes and mainly serve purposes such as connecting, adjusting, and replacing components. Understanding snap-fits is essential for product designers. Today, I will provide a detailed introduction to everything related to snap-fits in product design. Snap-fit is a commonly used connection and fastening structure in product design. It typically requires another complementary part to achieve the connection effect, and it is especially common in plastic components.",

The specific advantages are: Economical: Plastic snap-fits can be directly molded on plastic parts, eliminating the need for additional locking components such as screws or nuts during assembly, thereby saving costs. Effective: The connection strength of snap-fits can meet most product design requirements. In products requiring higher connection strength, snap-fits can be used as an auxiliary connection along with screws. Simple and Convenient: With proper design, snap-fit connections can enable quick assembly and disassembly, and the process may even require no additional tools.",

However, snap-fit connections also have some disadvantages: High Molding Cost: Except for specially designed cases (through-hole), forming snap-fits ininjection moldsgenerally requires the design ofslidersorlifters. The number of these mold structures can affect the overall mold cost. High Precision Requirements: Snap-fits require high precision in fitting. It is generally difficult to achieve the correct fit in onemold trial, often requiring two to three trial mold adjustments.",

This can lead to improper assembly, compromising connection quality. Insufficient Connection Strength: Unless the snap engagement is sufficient, snap-fits can easily loosen due to plastic part deformation. This is particularly problematic in products that need to pass drop tests, where snap-fit connections alone may not meet the test requirements. Limited Reusability: Except for snap-fits made of highly resilient materials or with special structural designs, most snap-fits have limited disassembly cycles.",

Irreversible: Once a snap-fit breaks, it fails completely and cannot be repaired, potentially resulting in the entire part being scrapped. A snap-fit connection requires two components: the base part and the assembly part. In most cases, the base part is larger, relatively stationary or fixed, and can be a single component or an assembly. It acts as the reference for the connection. For example, in automobiles, the car body serves as the base part for most trim components that need to be assembled. This can also be a single component or an assembly, generally smaller than the base part, and can be held in hand during the assembly process.",

Whether it’s the base part or the assembly part, the main functional areas ensuring the reliability of the snap-fit connection are known as constraint functional elements. There are two types: positioning elements and locking elements, usually referred to as positioners and lockers. For assemblies, these are specifically called positioning features and locking features, but for simplicity, we will call them positioners and lockers. Positioners are relatively non-flexible constraint elements that ensure precise positioning between the assembly part and the base part and provide separation resistance other than the locking force. They bear the main load during the constraint process.",

  {
    "text": "Common types of positioners include: pins, tapered pins, guides, wedges, claws, surfaces, edges, lugs, bosses, slots, holes, and live hinges. When a part has positioners, another part will have corresponding positioners to match, together forming a positioning pair. Lockers are constraint elements that elastically deform during assembly and return to their original position after assembly, forming a lock and providing holding force. Common types of lockers include: hooks, claws, rings, torsion bars, and ratchets. When a part has lockers, another part will have corresponding matching parts. Generally, the matching parts are positioners rather than another set of lockers, as they are robust, non-flexible elements. Lockers and their matching parts together form a locking pair.",
    "url": "https://firstmold.com/tips/snap-fits/"
  },
  {
    "text": "All lockers consist of two main elements: the deflection element for assembly and disassembly and the retaining element that contacts the assembly function element. The most common and varied type of locker is the cantilever snap-fit, which will be discussed in detail. In cantilever snap-fits, the deflection element is often the cantilever beam. The design of the beam’s shape and cross-section is flexible, with options such as rectangular, fan-shaped, U-shaped, or T-shaped. The rectangular cross-section is the most common, with U-shaped and T-shaped being variants aimed at increasing the beam’s cross-sectional area and providing stiffness. In cantilever snap-fits, the choice of retaining element can be independent of the deflection element (beam) itself.",
    "url": "https://firstmold.com/tips/snap-fits/"
  },
  {
    "text": "Retaining and deflection elements can be combined to meet different requirements. The most common forms are hook-type and sleeve-type. For hook-type retaining elements, a unique characteristic is that when a separation force acts on the locker, the reaction force’s line of action never aligns with the beam’s neutral axis (symmetry axis). There is always an offset (d), causing the beam to bend under significant separation force, particularly in the beam’s weakest direction. Even hooks with a retaining face angle of 90° or close to 90° can become unhooked under substantial force, and the root of the retaining element may fracture, causing failure. When both the hook and matching part have angles greater than 90°, the retaining strength significantly increases.",
    "url": "https://firstmold.com/tips/snap-fits/"
  },
  {
    "text": "This design is typically used in applications requiring high retaining strength, such as buckles on backpacks. For sleeve-type retaining elements, the ends are open frame or edge-like elements. Their characteristic is that the reaction force’s line of action passes through the beam’s neutral axis, avoiding deflection force and preventing beam bending. The retaining strength of cantilever snap-fits is determined by the material’s tensile and shear strength, giving sleeve-type retaining elements high holding strength. However, sleeve-type retaining elements have a drawback: their inherent low strength. During injection molding, a weld line forms at some point in the sleeve (where two fronts of molten material meet), reducing the structural strength at the end of the retaining element.",
    "url": "https://firstmold.com/tips/snap-fits/"
  },
  {
    "text": "Although weld lines are unavoidable, the strength can be increased by adjusting the structure of sleeve-type retaining elements, such as locally increasing the thickness or changing the weld line position. Additionally, rounding stress concentration corners, adding material to the back to convert through-holes to blind holes, or adding reinforcement ribs can enhance strength. By understanding and utilizing these elements effectively, product designers can optimize snap-fit connections for various applications. Plastic snap-fits can be classified based on the difficulty of disassembly into detachable snap-fits (live snaps) and non-detachable snap-fits (dead snaps). Detachable snap-fits can further be divided into easily detachable snap-fits and difficult-to-detach snap-fits.",

Difficult-to-Detach Snap-Fits: These snap-fit connections require tools for disassembly. Non-Detachable Snap-Fits: These connections can only be disassembled by destroying the parts. Plastic snap-fit connections primarily utilize the elastic deformation and recovery properties of plastic materials. The distinction among these three types of snap-fits lies in the difficulty of disengaging the snap-fit’s engaging surfaces from the mating surfaces of the base part. Thus, it is not solely about the amount of engagement. Some snap-fits may have a small engagement but are difficult or impossible to disassemble due to limited deformation space.",

Snap-fits can be classified into cantilever snap-fits, ring snap-fits, and ball snap-fits based on their shape. These are the most common and widely used types of snap-fits, with many forms evolved from this type. Cantilever snap-fits can be further subdivided into: Hook-type Cantilever Snap-Fits: The most commonly used cantilever snap-fit, where the force line has an offset with the neutral axis. Sleeve-type Cantilever snap fits: Less commonly used, where the force line coincides with the neutral axis. Special-shaped Cantilever Snap-Fits: Used on special occasions, known for their high disassembly frequency and long lifespan.",

This type of snap-fit is characterized by a ring or circular structure, suitable for applications where surrounding or securing a part is necessary. The torsional Snap Fit design is highly user-friendly, allowing connection or disassembly through rotation. In detail, the rotating part of the rotational snap-fit uses a precise gear design to ensure smooth and stable rotation.

Hook buckles, on the other hand, are S-shaped or hook-shaped, also fixed with screws, but more convenient and durable. Snap-fits can also be classified into linear motion snap-fits and rotational motion snap-fits. Linear motion snap-fits involve pushing or sliding movements, while rotational motion snap-fits involve flipping, twisting, or turning movements. The ultimate goal of snap-fit design is to achieve a successful connection and fixation between two parts.",

Other considerations includemanufacturabilityand cost-effectiveness. Connection reliability is the most critical design criterion in snap-fit design, generally considered from the following aspects: In product design, the required level of connection reliability is chosen based on the product’s positioning, component functionality, and cost. Not all designs need to meet all the above requirements. For example, if a design does not require frequent disassembly or maintenance, meeting the first three points may suffice.",

  {
    "text": "However, if frequent disassembly is needed, the snap-fit must maintain functionality post-disassembly, influencing the choice of snap-fit type or specific design parameters. For example, battery cover designs differ between power banks and remote controls. During the assembly or disassembly of snap-fits, the motion of the assembly part relative to the base part must be controlled. Without constraints, the final state of the assembly part would be uncertain and unstable. Constraints ensure that the assembly part moves correctly relative to the base part. Constraint completeness involves both positioning and locking. If locking is the ultimate goal of the snap-fit connection, then constraints are the fundamental requirements to achieve this goal.",

Assembly coordination considers whether the snap-fit base is designed for manual or machine assembly. Currently, most designs are based on manual assembly. Therefore, in the design process, in addition to considering the movement space of the snap-fit base itself, the space for human operation (ergonomics) must also be considered.

The process involves various steps, such as sorting, disassembly, cleaning, inspection and rebuilding. While disassembly is easy enough with mechanical fasteners, it’s more problematic with press fits. Also known as friction fits or interference fits, press fits are commonly employed in assembly due to their cost-effectiveness and simple design. These joints are particularly useful for cylindrical parts, such as axles and bearings. Press fits can be challenging to disassemble without causing plastic deformation, scratches and adhesion.",

For example, disassembling shaft-and-hub joints often requires applying torque and axial loading, which can cause deformations and make separation more difficult. Additionally, the loss of contact between the shaft and hub increases susceptibility to fretting wear. Corrosion is the most serious concern for disassembly. Corrosion can cause sticking or bonding of the parts, particularly after prolonged storage. This increases the amount of force needed to separate them. In fact, the amount of force needed to separate rusted joints can be twice that of noncorroded ones. Several parameters are important for successful disassembly of press fits.",

Disassembly should be carried out in a manner that avoids plastic and thermal strains.

These vibrations can decrease friction and extend the elastic-plastic range, potentially avoiding damage during disassembly.

For assemblies, these are specifically called positioning features and locking features, but for simplicity, we will call them positioners and lockers. Positioners are relatively non-flexible constraint elements that ensure precise positioning between the assembly part and the base part and provide separation resistance other than the locking force.

The most common and varied type of locker is the cantilever snap-fit, which will be discussed in detail. In cantilever snap-fits, the deflection element is often the cantilever beam. The design of the beam’s shape and cross-section is flexible, with options such as rectangular, fan-shaped, U-shaped, or T-shaped. The rectangular cross-section is the most common, with U-shaped and T-shaped being variants aimed at increasing the beam’s cross-sectional area and providing stiffness.

For hook-type retaining elements, a unique characteristic is that when a separation force acts on the locker, the reaction force’s line of action never aligns with the beam’s neutral axis (symmetry axis). There is always an offset (d), causing the beam to bend under significant separation force, particularly in the beam’s weakest direction. Even hooks with a retaining face angle of 90° or close to 90° can become unhooked under substantial force, and the root of the retaining element may fracture, causing failure. When both the hook and matching part have angles greater than 90°, the retaining strength significantly increases.",

For sleeve-type retaining elements, the ends are open frame or edge-like elements. Their characteristic is that the reaction force’s line of action passes through the beam’s neutral axis, avoiding deflection force and preventing beam bending. The retaining strength of cantilever snap-fits is determined by the material’s tensile and shear strength, giving sleeve-type retaining elements high holding strength. However, sleeve-type retaining elements have a drawback: their inherent low strength. During injection molding, a weld line forms at some point in the sleeve (where two fronts of molten material meet), reducing the structural strength at the end of the retaining element.",

Additionally, rounding stress concentration corners, adding material to the back to convert through-holes to blind holes, or adding reinforcement ribs can enhance strength. By understanding and utilizing these elements effectively, product designers can optimize snap-fit connections for various applications. Plastic snap-fits can be classified based on the difficulty of disassembly into detachable snap-fits (live snaps) and non-detachable snap-fits (dead snaps). Detachable snap-fits can further be divided into easily detachable snap-fits and difficult-to-detach snap-fits.",

Plastic snap-fit connections primarily utilize the elastic deformation and recovery properties of plastic materials. The distinction among these three types of snap-fits lies in the difficulty of disengaging the snap-fit’s engaging surfaces from the mating surfaces of the base part. Thus, it is not solely about the amount of engagement. Some snap-fits may have a small engagement but are difficult or impossible to disassemble due to limited deformation space.",

Without constraints, the final state of the assembly part would be uncertain and unstable. Constraints ensure that the assembly part moves correctly relative to the base part.

Snap-fit joints follow the basic principle of quickly and economically joining two different components by deflecting the protruding part of one component and catching it in an undercut depression in the mating component.",

    "text": "Every type of snap-fit joint follows this principle, where the joint should revert to a stress-free state after the joining process. The shape of the undercut determines whether the joint is separable or inseparable. The most commonly used and effective types of snap-fit joints are the cantilever, torsion, and annular snap joints. Cantilever snap-fit joints are among the most prevalent types of joints used in manufacturing. Their straightforward geometric shape makes them simple to incorporate into a snap-fit design, and the strain calculations during the joining process are also relatively uncomplicated. A cantilever snap joint’s fundamental structure comprises a cantilever beam featuring a tapered hook at its end and a corresponding recess in the mating component.",

Some of the key features of cantilever snap-fit joints include: Snap-fit joints can be either permanent or designed to be released upon applying a separate force, depending on the angle between the hook and the recess. Furthermore, in some designs, the cantilever does not come as a straight bar and may feature U-shaped or L-shaped configurations, which can be frequently seen in plastic components. U- and L-shaped cantilever joints have the benefit of providing extended cantilever support without needing extra space.",

A cantilever snap-fit design is recommended to have an entry and exit angle that are both less than 45 degrees and 5 degrees, respectively. It’s important to achieve an easy entry while preventing easy removal. The highest level of snap deflection for these types of designs denotes the moment at which the snap securely engages with the mating part without any breakdown. The maximum snap deflection value of a cantilever snap-fit design is determined by various factors, such as the snap’s cross-sectional area, length, and the maximum allowable strain of the material used.",

It requires rotational force to fasten two parts together by a twisting motion on either one or both torsion snap-fit joints. The force causes the torsion snap to deform and allows it to fit securely into its corresponding notch on the other part. Once in place, the torsion snap-fit joint is able to resist any forces that might otherwise pull the parts apart, making it an effective and efficient method of fastening. One of the most important considerations when designing a torsion snap-fit joint is carefully calculating the force required to deform the joint.",

To ensure optimum connectivity, the snap-fit rocker arm, and the torsion bar are molded together as a single unit. If the beam of the hook extends beyond the axis of the torsion bar, a seesaw mechanism is activated.

Snap-fit designs involve the bending of parts to achieve interlocking that can create stress concentrations at the points where the parts bend. It can cause the parts to crack or break under load or stress. Engineers use high-strength materials with stiffness to distribute the stress evenly across the part to prevent this problem. Zero root radius is not recommended in snap-fit designs. Creep refers to the irreversible deformation of material caused by stress. This phenomenon can eventually damage the connection between male and female snap-fit components, resulting in failure or loss of functionality.",

Maintaining clearance between mating parts, even under the most unfavorable conditions, is an effective way to address this issue. By doing so, the snap-fit components will remain relaxed and functional. If snap-fit parts are repeatedly assembled or disassembled, they may fail at stress levels below their rated capacity. This type of fatigue failure occurs at high loading frequencies. To mitigate this issue, it is advisable to carefully select a fatigue-resistant material for snap-fit components that will undergo high cycle frequencies.

To ensure optimal results, it is advisable to use a fillet radius that is at least 0.5 times the thickness of the cantilever base. When a cantilever snap-fit design has a uniform cross-section, it may encounter uneven or non-uniform strain distribution.

Therefore, repairs or even mold overhauls are necessary to produce high-quality products. Another common problem is porosity, which is the formation of non-desirable patterns, spots, marks, or unevenness directly on the surface of the finished operative part.

Operators can detect failure patterns in an injection mold early enough to avoid injection mold repair or replacement costs and losses due to a lack of production. Numerous signs indicate that the injection mold requires repair. One crucial first indication that your injection mold needs work is visible flashes on the final part.

It indicates that the mold requires realignment or the clamping system of the press requires repair. Any visible marks, dents, or uneven surfaces on the final parts show that the mold is probably worn out or damaged somehow. Such imperfections include problems like wear in the mold cavity, contamination, and inadequate venting. They lead to disturbance of material flow and cooling.

This situation results in the production of distorted products or longer cycle times. By performing muzzle inspection and replacing worn pins, operators solve ejector problems early.

It results in losses from the molecules during the repair process. In the long run, it might be more than the cost of a replacement mold if this aspect includes the overall loss of production time and poor-quality molecules.

This process is generally performed manually. For surfaces with high-quality requirements, we can use ultra-fine polishing methods. Ultra-fine polishing employs special grinding tools in a slurry containing abrasives, which are pressed against the workpiece surface and rotated at high speeds. This method can achieve a surface roughness of Ra0.008 μm. Physical polishing of molds is currently the most widely used polishing method among mold manufacturers.",

Semi-finishing polishing primarily uses sandpaper and kerosene. The sequence of sandpaper use is 400# → 600# → 800# → 1000# → 1200# → 1500#. Note that #1500 sandpaper is only suitable for hardened mold steel (above 52HRC) and not for pre-hardened steel, as it may damage the surface, preventing the desired polishing effect.

For even more precise polishing, an absolutely clean environment is necessary, as dust, smoke, dandruff, and saliva can ruin the high-precision polished surface. After completing the polishing process, we should protect the workpiece surface from dust. When polishing stops, all polishing agents and lubricants should be carefully removed to ensure the surface is clean, and a layer of mold rust-preventative coating should be sprayed on the workpiece surface.",

The core challenge of chemical polishing lies in the preparation of the polishing solution.

Compared to chemical polishing, it can eliminate the effects of cathodic reactions, offering better results. The electrolytic polishing process involves two steps: In ultrasonic polishing, we placed the workpiece in an abrasive suspension and subjected it to an ultrasonic field. The ultrasonic vibrations cause the abrasive to polish the workpiece surface. Ultrasonic processing generates minimal macroscopic force, preventing workpiece deformation, but the tooling and setup can be challenging. Ultrasonic processing can be combined with chemical or electrochemical methods.",

The cavitation effect of ultrasound in the liquid also inhibits the corrosion process, contributing to surface brightening. Fluid polishing uses high-speed flowing liquid-carrying abrasives to polish the workpiece surface. Common methods include abrasive jet machining, liquid jet machining, and fluid dynamic grinding. In fluid dynamic grinding, a hydraulically driven medium containing abrasive particles flows rapidly back and forth over the workpiece surface. The medium typically consists of special compounds (polymer-like substances) mixed with abrasives, such as silicon carbide powder.",

When using 8000# polishing paste, the usual load is 100-200g/cm², but maintaining this load precisely is difficult. To facilitate this, a thin and narrow handle can be made on a wooden strip, or part of a bamboo strip can be cut to make it more flexible. This helps control the polishing pressure, ensuring the mold surface pressure is not too high. When using diamond polishing, not only must the work surface be clean, but the worker’s hands must also be very clean.

The shape of the grinding tools should closely match the surface shape of the mold to ensure the workpiece does not get deformed during grinding. The biggest issue encountered in daily polishing is “over-polishing,” where the longer the polishing time, the worse the surface quality of the mold. Over-polishing manifests in two phenomena: “orange peel” and “pitting.” Over-polishing commonly occurs during mechanical polishing. Irregularly rough surfaces are referred to as “orange peel.” There are many causes of orange peel, with the most common being mold surface overheating or excessive carburization. Excessive polishing pressure and prolonged polishing time are the main reasons for orange peel.",

    "text": "For example, polishing wheels can generate heat that easily causes orange peel. Harder steels can withstand more polishing pressure, while relatively softer steels are prone to over-polishing. Research has shown that the time for over-polishing varies with the hardness of the steel. When poor surface quality is detected, many people increase the polishing pressure and extend the polishing time, which often worsens the surface quality. Non-metallic impurities in the steel, usually hard and brittle oxides, are pulled out from the steel surface during polishing, forming micro-pits or pitting. The main factors causing pitting are: 1) Excessive polishing pressure and prolonged polishing time. 2) Insufficient purity of the steel, high content of hard impurities. 3) Rust on the mold surface.",

The minimum acceptable percent compactness is 75% in the prime sealing area. Ghost wrinkles have length and width but no depth. The face of the hook is smooth indicating that the double seam has been suitably compressed or ironed out. These \"wrinkles\" are usually the remains, that is to say, shadows of second operation wrinkles that have been completely ironed out. They may also be indicative that compound between the body hook and cover hook was highly compressed. In either event, since the end hook is smooth, ghost wrinkles are not indicative of looseness.",
