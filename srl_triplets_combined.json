Toys are typically lower cost products, and must be assembled efficiently for the least amount of labor and cost. What types of joining processes and equipment are toy manufacturers looking for today? Toy manufacturers are using mechanical fit (interlocking parts), adhesives, and screws to fasten toys together. Plastic welding is also used in certain types of designs. What are the advantages of using screws for toy assembly? Screws offer several advantages for toy assembly.

As the use of CAD software has become more prevalent throughout the toy industry, the shapes of the plastic parts have become more complex. For example, toys that transform from one shape to another by moving components into different positions have very complex shapes. As parts become more complex, access to the fasteners themselves becomes more challenging.

Screw sizes used in toys are becoming smaller today, as joint analysis and cost drive the manufacturer toward using the smallest fastener that will achieve the desired joint integrity. Smaller screws are often more difficult to automate, as the clearance area around smaller screws is usually more restrictive, leading to problems with access on automated systems.

I thought he had disassembled it to diagnose.. nope. I wasn’t over his shoulder. 128oz of vinegar later and it still won’t drain. Pump needs to be replaced. Still fails to drain. Looks like I’m taking the dishwasher apart this weekend. Good thing I find tinkering with appliances fun, because I don’t think it’s worth calling repair people ever again.. unless it’s factory certified on a commercial grade appliance. —————- Update: the appliance repair guy for the dishwasher came back because nothing was fixed. He insisted that the drain pump wasn’t the issue, but swapped it out because “we had it”.",

    "text": "PostedJune 7, 2017byCharles Morris&filed underNewswire,The Vehicles. It’s not unheard-of for financial analysts to tear down a vehicle to get an accurate estimate of what it costs to produce. Back in 2015, a consulting firmtook apart and reverse-engineered a BMW i3. More recently, a team from UBS disassembled a Chevy Bolt and published a cost analysis of the new EV. However, its report went much further, making some bold predictions about the future of the auto industry. UBS’s main goal was to estimate GM’s cost to build the $37,000 vehicle. It concluded that the Bolt’s electric powertrain is $4,600 cheaper to produce than previously estimated, “with much cost reduction potential left.” However, GM is losing money on the Bolt.",

    "text": "“We estimate that GM loses $7,400 in earnings before interest and tax on every Bolt sold today, mainly due to a lack of scale,” wrote the UBS team. This figure is a little under what other industry observers have estimated. As Elon Musk and others have explained, through the tortuous math of California’s ZEV program, GM earns credits that offset its losses on sales of the Bolt, buthas no incentive to sell more than about 30,000 units per year. However, UBS’s findings imply that, if GM could squeeze out some costs and increase the scale of production, it could be earning a profit on the Bolt before long. UBS extrapolated its findings about Bolt production costs to make a bold prophecy: EVs will prove to be “the most disruptive car category since the Model T Ford.”",

UBS expects this price parity to be reached first in Europe, where gas prices are higher, and in the US several years later. “This will create an inflexion point for demand,” said the UBS analysts, with typically Swiss understatement. Once true price parity is breached, a tidal wave of disruption could sweep the industry. UBS has raised its forecast for EV sales in 2025 to 14.2 million – 14% of global car sales. It also predicts that automakers will start earning a profit of about 5% on EVs by 2023, equivalent to today’s average profit margin.",

These methods contain both simple options, and some that use luxurious tools such as an impact gun or welder. Use caution, as some of the methods described can cause damage to your parts and might injure you if you do not take proper safety precaution (read: don’t be stupid). Try a 6-point wrench or socket on your seized nut/bolt. Start by rocking the bolt by tightening then loosing, this may be all you need to break through the rust. Try and avoid 12-point wrenches and sockets as they likely to slip and strip the bolt head. Another great tool I have found that is made by Irwin Tools is there Original Locking Wrench.",

With any luck, The heat has broken the rust seal on the bolt allowing it to turn. This is not a good idea around flammables or rubber gaskets/bushings.

Simply grind the nut and bolt until the nut no longer exists and pull the bolt right out.

Using an air hammer on low pressure will make a nice vibrating but strong tool enough to loosen rust sometimes. Believe me, It works. If you tune the air pressure correctly, It will have a distinct hum. On the other end of this spectrum, if the first doesnt work, is to use a blunt or pointed tip on the head of a bolt with full PSI to the tool. This rapidly hammers it breaking the rust up mechanically. Even greater when penetrating oil has been applied. I have found this works very, very well.

Another option for removing a rusty and stripped bolt? You can always repair the hex portion of the faster! How? Its simple! A great way to do this is to add a new nut to the old bolt head! A great way to do this, is to use a wire brush to clean the head of the bolt. Pretty clean is acceptable. From here, An appropriate sized nut can be MIG/Wire Feed welded on top of the bolt to provide a new gripping surface for the wrench onto the bolt! Nifty eh? Well, Guess what! This heating to cherry read while welding is also a great heat shock to the corrosion holding the fastener on! This makes it easier to remove!",

These tools focus on a power and fast rotational hammering action to shock and loosen the bolt in one motion! They are much less likely to round off a bolt then using a breaker bar! However, They tend to occasionally snap rusty bolts off unfortunately. Use with care, Especially if you have a powerful one! There is not much to them, Simply put them on a rusty nut and depress the trigger and let the tool hammer away! These are all methods I’ve used personally and have found work for me, I hope this has helped make the frustration and difficulty of stuck nuts and bolts a thing of the past for you.",

    "text": "Hi Guys. This a review and disassembly of the F4001 (and F3001) radio by Icom America, Inc. I posted this tech review on myblogbut wanted to share it with those of you who may be on the fence about the Icom radios. I would definitely recommend this radio over the RDU and RDV series by Motorola. Icom IC-F4001 | IC-F3001 Radio: What’s Inside, Disassembly, and Tech Review Only a little more than a year ago Icom America, Inc. released a new, easy to use, portable radio in the business industry and commercial market. The Icom IC-F4001 (UHF) or F3001 (VHF) is similar to it’s siblings, most notably the Icom F4011/3011 but with a few exceptions.",

    "text": "What makes this radio great is the addition of MDC, 2-tone, and 5-tone signalling which puts it in direct competition with the Motorola CP200 as the standard for basic two-way radios. Add on a Lithium Ion battery and low-profile antenna and you have yourself a winner! Lookout BPR40, TK3302, and CP200 there are waves being made! With any new radio I like to take a look at what’s “under the hood” since beauty doesn’t mean much when we are talking about two-way radios. A dependable, quality crafted radio is what both business and public safety industries rely on to carry out daily operations. These users need rugged, reliable equipment that puts function first, and form second (yet not forgotten). So let’s take a look inside this Icom portable radio!",

You will need a spanner wrench or funky looking pliers such as these to remove the nut from the threaded antenna shaft. There is a silver nut that has no edges but only two indents on opposite sides of the nut. You can use the pliers to catch the indents and twist counter-clockwise to loosen up the nut. Yo can now use a small flat-head screwdriver to pry the bottom of the chassis out of the plastic housing. Pull down to clear the top channel/volume selectors and antenna shaft from the housing.

    "text": "A major flaw of the CP110 and RDX radios by Motorola is the golden flexible arms that are attached to the circuit board and make contact with the speaker when the case is closed. I have seen many RDX radios with broken arms or not making good contact with the speaker which causes intermittent audio. On the top is the rubber grommet which prevents water and debris from entering the radio through the top selector knobs or antenna shaft: Soldier connections look solid and circuit board is cleanly laid out. Here is one of my pet peeves!! The other common issue I find on Motorola CP110 and RDX radios is the soldier joints on the PTT button-they break off all the time! Do you have a CP110, RDU or RDV radio that will receive but won’t transmit??",

This guy came, disassembled my oven, collected his service fee.. then came back with parts two days later. Charged me an additional $400, told me could fix it, left it in pieces.",

They fixed it for $300 plus parts ($700 total cost) Did get my money back from the scammer via a 93a demand letter and BBB complaint against the broker who sent him. Sears appliance repair came, stripped a screw, and said I needed to replace the entire back panel of the fridge… costing $800. Then proceeded to use a dremel to remove the screw. Replaced the evap fan myself for $28. We have very hard water, pump stopped pumping. I’m sure it’s gunked. I bought a replacement OEM part and wanted to do it myself, but my wife reminded me I have no time. Repair guy comes while I’m on a conference call. My sister is there — part is in front of him.",

Since it's synthetic, it doesn't gum up at all. Watches can run well past the life span of synthetic oils. When we use animal/vegetable oil, the lubricant eventually gums up due to natural occurring substances. On the other hand, synthetic oil literally dries up and evaporates. This leaves the pivots running dry on the jewels which will cause added friction and wear on the pivots. Added friction and wear on the pivots will eventually cause metal sheering and gunk to build up (one of the reasons why overhaul is recommended after several years).

Make sure that you're careful when using this. Do not get it on the top/bottom lids of the barrel. MOEBIUS 8200-We'll use 8200 for mainsprings (some use it on the setting system for older watches).

The most basic explanation of Epilame is that it's used to change the surface tension on a part so that oil doesn't run off or spread. Some common parts we'll use Epilame on are the escape wheel, pallet fork jewels/stones, tip of the seconds wheel, cap jewels, and reverser wheels. Take a look at that escape wheel. This is a good close up magnification on a ladies caliber. Do you see that drop of oil that’s literally hanging on from the escape wheel tooth?

Epilame alters the surface tension of whatever you’re applying it to so that oil will likely remain in place. We’ll want to use Epilame because modern watches are running at such high speeds that oil is likely to either flick away or spread around. Take a look at the link in my bio for more info. We use epilame on common parts with extremely high transitional force such as the escape wheel and pallet fork jewels. We will also use it on the second wheel pivot at the end and balance cap jewels. At the manufacture level, they will have epilame’d a good majority of the movement. Outside of that, the movement does not require another epilame treatment. ______",

Typically, it involves a head and a tail at opposite ends of the hardware. Generally, these comprise a rounded head and a cylindrical shaft. They notably resemble a metallic pin in shape. Metallic dowels are different from regular bolts and nuts as they use specific techniques that make use of thefastenersand have permanent metallic joinery to the sheets.

    "text": "They are not ordinary fasteners because they have unique installation procedures, giving lasting and resilient joints. You can install rivets by drilling or punching a hole in the job material. Next, place the rivet and deform the tail. The simplest way is to bore a hole in the material of the components to connect, because it’s quicker and easier to accomplish. To get the desired fastening, the diameter of the drilled hole should be about 1.5 times larger than the rivet diameter. After insertion, the tail emerges from the opposite end, and you can twist it. When you hammer or apply force to the flat side of the tail, the material flattens to about 1½ times its original size.",

Before they are fully cured, take the edge of a metal spatula and remove the soft excess outside of the joint. You can clean further with a paper towel and IPA / MEK if necessary. Cured acrylic adhesive is much harder to remove and may require harsher solvents such as acetone or even methylene chloride. Similar to other adhesive spillages, don the appropriate attire, ventilate the area, and soak up with a spill kit, sand, or inert absorbent material.

Industrial lighting or light coming through windows may cause some grades of UV adhesive to cure, so dim the lights and clean up ASAP. Solvent such as IPA or MEK work well. If the joint isn’t fully cured, treat the parts carefully – if the joint parts open you could end up with a “crazy paving” effect. If the adhesive has dried, you will need to use a stronger solvent such as acetone or even methylene chloride. It is a good idea to try to remove adhesive squeezed outside the bond area before exposing to UV light.

The sticky finish traps lead dust and airborne fibers making it ideal for over-coating lead paint or asbestos prior to removal or demolition. Grip-Tack is also used as a lead paint adhesive primer over high gloss surfaces containing lead paint. Inspect all surfaces to be treated to insure they are clean, dry and free of all foreign matter including: dust, rust, grease, oil, mildew, glue size, calcimine, wax, soap, loose paint, etc.",

And the probability of disassembly damage formation and evolution is also relatively small on this kind of textured surface.

If the large abrasive particle occupies the front end of the pit earlier (Figure10b), it is difficult to be pushed away from the front end of pit by the small one because the bottom of the pit is rough and the friction resistance is large. This makes the new smaller abrasive particle can be collected by Ellipse-1 easily but hard by Ellipse-2. So in this case, the particle collection ability of Ellipse-1 is better than that of Ellipse-2. This gives the reason why the damage reduction ability of Ellipse-1 and Ellipse-2 is very close, but the former is slightly higher than the latter (Figure6c).",

Effective: The connection strength of snap-fits can meet most product design requirements. In products requiring higher connection strength, snap-fits can be used as an auxiliary connection along with screws.

Common types of lockers include: hooks, claws, rings, torsion bars, and ratchets. When a part has lockers, another part will have corresponding matching parts. Generally, the matching parts are positioners rather than another set of lockers, as they are robust, non-flexible elements. Lockers and their matching parts together form a locking pair.",

The most common and varied type of locker is the cantilever snap-fit, which will be discussed in detail. In cantilever snap-fits, the deflection element is often the cantilever beam. The design of the beam’s shape and cross-section is flexible, with options such as rectangular, fan-shaped, U-shaped, or T-shaped. The rectangular cross-section is the most common, with U-shaped and T-shaped being variants aimed at increasing the beam’s cross-sectional area and providing stiffness.

For hook-type retaining elements, a unique characteristic is that when a separation force acts on the locker, the reaction force’s line of action never aligns with the beam’s neutral axis (symmetry axis). There is always an offset (d), causing the beam to bend under significant separation force, particularly in the beam’s weakest direction. Even hooks with a retaining face angle of 90° or close to 90° can become unhooked under substantial force, and the root of the retaining element may fracture, causing failure.

The retaining strength of cantilever snap-fits is determined by the material’s tensile and shear strength, giving sleeve-type retaining elements high holding strength.

Or tried to push a rubber hose onto a pipe only to find it wouldn’t slide into place because the fit was just too tight? These tasks can be very frustrating and can often require considerable physical effort and time. Rubber materials are inherently difficult to install, remove, or otherwise manipulate – even when wet. The slip resistant nature of rubber creates a challenge during the assembly and repair of rubber parts. Common assembly problems that may occur include ill-fitting, misaligned or damaged parts, rolling O-rings, uneven cuts, and worker injury. Usingtemporary rubber assembly lubricantscan solve these problems.",

By reducing the surface tension between the two surfaces, rubber parts can slide into place easily, providing a tight fit. 2. Achieve Closer Fits:Engineers can design lower tolerance parts. The force needed to install the parts when a lubricant is used is greatly reduced. Since the lubrication is only temporary, once dry, the parts stay in place resulting in a tight fit. 3.

    "text": "Using a rubber assembly lubricant, which enables the parts to slide easily into place, can solve these problems by reducing or eliminating damage to parts. 4. Increase Production Rates:Applying an assembly lubricant to the rubber part makes the rubber slippery, so parts can easily slide into place. After the lubricant dries, the lubricity goes away and mated parts maintain a tight fit. The assembly process becomes more productive because it is easier and quicker. 5. Help to Avoid Worker Injuries:Lubricants reduce the insertion force needed for rubber assembly. Workers can more easily push parts into place, reducing the amount of musculoskeletal, slippage, and repetitive stress related injuries that can be caused by using too much force to insert a rubber part.",

The process involves various steps, such as sorting, disassembly, cleaning, inspection and rebuilding. While disassembly is easy enough with mechanical fasteners, it’s more problematic with press fits. Also known as friction fits or interference fits, press fits are commonly employed in assembly due to their cost-effectiveness and simple design. These joints are particularly useful for cylindrical parts, such as axles and bearings. Press fits can be challenging to disassemble without causing plastic deformation, scratches and adhesion.",

For example, disassembling shaft-and-hub joints often requires applying torque and axial loading, which can cause deformations and make separation more difficult. Additionally, the loss of contact between the shaft and hub increases susceptibility to fretting wear. Corrosion is the most serious concern for disassembly. Corrosion can cause sticking or bonding of the parts, particularly after prolonged storage. This increases the amount of force needed to separate them. In fact, the amount of force needed to separate rusted joints can be twice that of noncorroded ones. Several parameters are important for successful disassembly of press fits.",

Disassembly should be carried out in a manner that avoids plastic and thermal strains.

Applying vibrations with a force of 1,000 newtons and a frequency of 700 hertz did not have a significant effect on disassembly force. When those parameters were increased to 5,000 newtons and 1,500 hertz, the breaking force was slightly less, about 24.6 kilonewtons. Higher frequencies are thought to have a greater impact on elastoplastic deformation and surface roughness, resulting in a reduced friction force and thus a decrease in disassembly force.

If the substrates are passive (low iron or copper content), or the ambient temperature is low, the cure reaction may be slow.

In the wheel hub of a bicycle, gears and bearings are usually assembled by press fit to ensure that they will not loosen when rotating at high speeds. Press fit is a standard mechanical assembly method that applies pressure to insert one part into the hole or sleeve of another part so that they fit tightly together. The outer diameter of the inserted part (usually a shaft, pin, sleeve, etc.) is slightly larger than the inner diameter of the mating part (usually a hole or sleeve).",

Effective: The connection strength of snap-fits can meet most product design requirements. In products requiring higher connection strength, snap-fits can be used as an auxiliary connection along with screws.

The design of the beam’s shape and cross-section is flexible, with options such as rectangular, fan-shaped, U-shaped, or T-shaped. The rectangular cross-section is the most common, with U-shaped and T-shaped being variants aimed at increasing the beam’s cross-sectional area and providing stiffness.

For hook-type retaining elements, a unique characteristic is that when a separation force acts on the locker, the reaction force’s line of action never aligns with the beam’s neutral axis (symmetry axis). There is always an offset (d), causing the beam to bend under significant separation force, particularly in the beam’s weakest direction. Even hooks with a retaining face angle of 90° or close to 90° can become unhooked under substantial force, and the root of the retaining element may fracture, causing failure.

The retaining strength of cantilever snap-fits is determined by the material’s tensile and shear strength, giving sleeve-type retaining elements high holding strength. However, sleeve-type retaining elements have a drawback: their inherent low strength.

Without constraints, the final state of the assembly part would be uncertain and unstable. Constraints ensure that the assembly part moves correctly relative to the base part.

This is similar to the guidelines for injection molding, but since we are not dealing with milling, where rounding internal shapes happens by default, the rounding should be added to every corner at best. The third principle is that sharp corners at the top and front of a typical snap fit should also be rounded. This is to ensure strength and guarantee the 1 mm thickness in all areas. By removing sharp edges at the design stage, the engineer ensures proper interaction with the other aspects of the system.",

The fourth principleensuresproper tolerances between the snap-fit and the surrounding elements. Just like a good injection molded design, 3D-printed parts must be designed with a proper fit.

Included in the development of the prototype system was the design of a disassembly tool that uses three force-sensing resistors to provide force feedback information. A pneumatically actuated vacuum gripper and electromagnet system was also developed for recovering the snap-fit cover and batteries once they were released by the disassembly tool. The disassembly module was mounted on the tool head of a three-axis translational motion robot, and a Visual Basic application was developed to interface and control the robot with a Galil digital motion controller.",

It’s a popular method in the manufacturing industry that relies on the elasticity of the material. Snap-fit designs, with their simplicity, offer several advantages such as reduced assembly time and costs. These designs come in different types, each having its own set of advantages and limitations. As a mechanical fastening system, snap-fit designs rely on a protrusion, or “snap”, on one part that fits into a corresponding recess, or “snap seat”, on the other part to create a snap-fit joint. When two parts are pressed together, the snap flexes slightly and then snaps into place, creating a secure and reliable joint.",

    "text": "The twisting motion and assembly mechanism of torsion snap joints differentiate them from cantilever snap-fit designs and you can commonly see them as a part of many automotive, electronics, and medical parts and devices. It requires rotational force to fasten two parts together by a twisting motion on either one or both torsion snap-fit joints. The force causes the torsion snap to deform and allows it to fit securely into its corresponding notch on the other part. Once in place, the torsion snap-fit joint is able to resist any forces that might otherwise pull the parts apart, making it an effective and efficient method of fastening. One of the most important considerations when designing a torsion snap-fit joint is carefully calculating the force required to deform the joint.",

With the development of new flexible yet springy materials, such as molded plastic, and new manufacturing processes, many new variations in these types of connectors have been invented, and are commonly called snap-fits. They can be found in on our phones, laptops, keys, and other household devices. Engineers have studied and developed these snap-fits, creating formulae concerning the amount of deflection allowed on the components, amount of torque one can take, and the amount of space one can allow in order to be detached.[2] Molds of the parts are created and hot liquid plastic is poured into the molds. The molds contain the shape of the parts and the snapping component built in.",

When snap-fits are being made, the producer needs to determine where the stresses of the parts will be applied to when assembled, or they break during assembly.[3]The high production costs are due to the amount of calculation and precision that must be done in order to create a strong snap-fit.[2][4]Another reason is the creation of molds; they are more time-consuming from the integration of parts in the product.[5] The design of the snap-fit determines what it can be used for.",

The annular snap-fit utilizes a hoop-strain to hold into place. Hoop-strain is the expansion of the circumference of the more elastic piece as it is pushed onto the more rigid piece.

The amount of dissociation from the surfactant is dependent upon the type of surfactant. Iodine solubility is very limited in water. Generally recommended usage for iodophors is 12.5 to 25ppm for 1 min. It is generally thought that the bactericidal activity of iodine is through direct halogenation of proteins. More recent theories have centered upon cell wall damage and destruction of microbial enzyme activity. Iodophors, like chlorine compounds, have a very broad spectrum: being active against bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds, fungi, and protozoans. Iodine is highly temperature-dependent and vaporizes at 120°F. Thus, it is limited to lower temperature applications.",

However, because of the lower solubility in QACs composed of large carbon chains, these sanitizers may have lower activity than short chain structures.

As far as the tool production is concerned, the tool material machinability, polishability, and heat treatment response are of great significance. Toughness, wear resistance, hot hardness, and resistance to softening are some of the important performance factors. The failure mechanism encountered in cold working tools, e.g. stamping tools and dies, comprise abrasive and adhesive wear or mixed wear (caused by sliding contact), chipping at cutting edges and corners (fatigue), plastic deformation (exceeding the yield strength locally), cracking (fatigue), and galling (the same mechanism as in adhesive wear).",

To prevent grinding out negative drafts or protect some mating surfaces, attach saw blades or sandpaper to the edges for protection, achieving ideal results. 6). When grinding the mold’s flat surfaces, move the oil stone handle back and forth, keeping the handle as flat as possible, not exceeding 25°; a greater angle may forcefully cause coarse scratches on the workpiece. 7). If using a copper or bamboo piece to press the sandpaper for polishing the workpiece surface, ensure the sandpaper size does not exceed the tool area to avoid grinding unintended areas. 8). Avoid using a grinding machine to repair the parting surface, as the grinding wheel head leaves a rough and wavy surface.",

    "text": "If necessary, the grinding wheel head must be adjusted for concentric balance. 9). The shape of the grinding tools should closely match the surface shape of the mold to ensure the workpiece does not get deformed during grinding. The biggest issue encountered in daily polishing is “over-polishing,” where the longer the polishing time, the worse the surface quality of the mold. Over-polishing manifests in two phenomena: “orange peel” and “pitting.” Over-polishing commonly occurs during mechanical polishing. Irregularly rough surfaces are referred to as “orange peel.” There are many causes of orange peel, with the most common being mold surface overheating or excessive carburization. Excessive polishing pressure and prolonged polishing time are the main reasons for orange peel.",

    "text": "For example, polishing wheels can generate heat that easily causes orange peel. Harder steels can withstand more polishing pressure, while relatively softer steels are prone to over-polishing. Research has shown that the time for over-polishing varies with the hardness of the steel. When poor surface quality is detected, many people increase the polishing pressure and extend the polishing time, which often worsens the surface quality. Non-metallic impurities in the steel, usually hard and brittle oxides, are pulled out from the steel surface during polishing, forming micro-pits or pitting. The main factors causing pitting are: 1) Excessive polishing pressure and prolonged polishing time. 2) Insufficient purity of the steel, high content of hard impurities. 3) Rust on the mold surface.",

Include a 2030 target for textiles-textiles recycling target as well as a fibre-to-fibre sub-target (for when the former is no longer an option to avoid premature downcycling). These targets should increase over time. 4.",

Plumb jewelry solders are fabricated containing exactly the correct amount of gold to match the karat specifications (see chart below). Repair Jewelry Solderis intended for making small repairs that are barely noticeable. Often times, jewelers will use these to size or fix older pieces of jewelry. They offer the same benefits as plumb solders and are about four karats below plumb. (A 14K repair solder is actually 10.8K.) Refining customers may question why the 14K is not 58.33% gold.

Some of my customers are only willing to fix their device as cheaply as possible so they can turn around and trade it in, while I understand where they're are coming from, its making keeping your device for longer, no longer a thing.

TLDR: Business is slow, no one wants to fix their device sayings its to expensive (When they have a $1000 device in their hand). I blame the big guys, \"trade in and get blah blah blah\". Customers think $60 is to much, rather get a new one. Tried to offer deals, still to expensive. Im even surprised if the mechanics shops are having it worse.

The new iPhone 13 completely disables its flagship Face ID functionality when you replace its screen.

Tens of thousands of repair shops around the world support their communities by replacing screens for customers at competitive prices.

An authorized Apple technician can make an iPhone 13 accept a new screen with a few clicks inside theirsecret software—no heating, desoldering, or resoldering required. Apple’s techs can also keep True Tone working, something that independent repair techs have not yet achieved with third-party programmers on newer iPhone 12 and 13 models. In other words, for those who can access Apple’s network, replacing a screen on the iPhone 13 is no different than before. For independent shops, everything is different.",

In general, there are three steps in the welding repair procedure: The steps in preparation for welding include the following: Prior to repair welding, ensure safety compliance by inspecting the designated area, removing flammable materials, and addressing potential hazards like toxic substances. The immediate work area must be thoroughly cleaned from all contaminants such as dirt, grease, oil, rust, paint, and plastic coverings. The cleaning method varies based on the material and workpiece location. Options include steam cleaning, solvent cleaning, abrasive blast cleaning, pickling, solvent dip cleaning, and power tool cleaning.",

During machinery repair welding, it is essential to protect unremoved parts from weld spatter, flame-cutting sparks, and other debris. Sheet metal guards or baffles can shield adjacent machinery, while asbestos cloth is suitable for machined surfaces. For complex repair jobs, bracing or clamping is required to support heavy parts or handle external loads on the weld-repaired component. Temporary braces can be welded to the structure undergoing repair. In repair jobs, metal removal is needed for a full-penetration weld.",

Preheating and flame cutting or gouging are integral to welding preparation and can be seen as part of the welding process. Preheating should match welding requirements, although its significance might be slightly less due to smaller stresses. Nevertheless, both flame cutting and gouging can subject the metal to thermal shock, similar to welding. The oxygen fuel gas-cutting torch with special gouging tips is commonly used. Cracks can be detected during flame gouging by observing heated edges. Air carbon arc cutting is also widely used. Mechanical chipping and grinding may be used for unsuitable metals.",

Toys are typically lower cost products, and must be assembled efficiently for the least amount of labor and cost. What types of joining processes and equipment are toy manufacturers looking for today? Toy manufacturers are using mechanical fit (interlocking parts), adhesives, and screws to fasten toys together. Plastic welding is also used in certain types of designs. What are the advantages of using screws for toy assembly? Screws offer several advantages for toy assembly.

As the use of CAD software has become more prevalent throughout the toy industry, the shapes of the plastic parts have become more complex. For example, toys that transform from one shape to another by moving components into different positions have very complex shapes. As parts become more complex, access to the fasteners themselves becomes more challenging.

Screw sizes used in toys are becoming smaller today, as joint analysis and cost drive the manufacturer toward using the smallest fastener that will achieve the desired joint integrity. Smaller screws are often more difficult to automate, as the clearance area around smaller screws is usually more restrictive, leading to problems with access on automated systems.

I thought he had disassembled it to diagnose.. nope. I wasn’t over his shoulder. 128oz of vinegar later and it still won’t drain. Pump needs to be replaced. Still fails to drain. Looks like I’m taking the dishwasher apart this weekend. Good thing I find tinkering with appliances fun, because I don’t think it’s worth calling repair people ever again.. unless it’s factory certified on a commercial grade appliance. —————- Update: the appliance repair guy for the dishwasher came back because nothing was fixed.

It’s not unheard-of for financial analysts to tear down a vehicle to get an accurate estimate of what it costs to produce. Back in 2015, a consulting firmtook apart and reverse-engineered a BMW i3. More recently, a team from UBS disassembled a Chevy Bolt and published a cost analysis of the new EV. However, its report went much further, making some bold predictions about the future of the auto industry. UBS’s main goal was to estimate GM’s cost to build the $37,000 vehicle. It concluded that the Bolt’s electric powertrain is $4,600 cheaper to produce than previously estimated, “with much cost reduction potential left.” However, GM is losing money on the Bolt.",

This figure is a little under what other industry observers have estimated. As Elon Musk and others have explained, through the tortuous math of California’s ZEV program, GM earns credits that offset its losses on sales of the Bolt, buthas no incentive to sell more than about 30,000 units per year. However, UBS’s findings imply that, if GM could squeeze out some costs and increase the scale of production, it could be earning a profit on the Bolt before long. UBS extrapolated its findings about Bolt production costs to make a bold prophecy: EVs will prove to be “the most disruptive car category since the Model T Ford.”",

UBS expects this price parity to be reached first in Europe, where gas prices are higher, and in the US several years later. “This will create an inflexion point for demand,” said the UBS analysts, with typically Swiss understatement. Once true price parity is breached, a tidal wave of disruption could sweep the industry. UBS has raised its forecast for EV sales in 2025 to 14.2 million – 14% of global car sales.

Use caution, as some of the methods described can cause damage to your parts and might injure you if you do not take proper safety precaution (read: don’t be stupid). Try a 6-point wrench or socket on your seized nut/bolt. Start by rocking the bolt by tightening then loosing, this may be all you need to break through the rust. Try and avoid 12-point wrenches and sockets as they likely to slip and strip the bolt head. Another great tool I have found that is made by Irwin Tools is there Original Locking Wrench.",

Simply grind the nut and bolt until the nut no longer exists and pull the bolt right out.

Using an air hammer on low pressure will make a nice vibrating but strong tool enough to loosen rust sometimes. Believe me, It works. If you tune the air pressure correctly, It will have a distinct hum. On the other end of this spectrum, if the first doesnt work, is to use a blunt or pointed tip on the head of a bolt with full PSI to the tool. This rapidly hammers it breaking the rust up mechanically. Even greater when penetrating oil has been applied. I have found this works very, very well. To my recent discovery, There is actually a brake bleeder tool made by Phoenix Systems called a Bleeder Buster.",

Another option for removing a rusty and stripped bolt? You can always repair the hex portion of the faster! How? Its simple! A great way to do this is to add a new nut to the old bolt head! A great way to do this, is to use a wire brush to clean the head of the bolt. Pretty clean is acceptable. From here, An appropriate sized nut can be MIG/Wire Feed welded on top of the bolt to provide a new gripping surface for the wrench onto the bolt! Nifty eh? Well, Guess what! This heating to cherry read while welding is also a great heat shock to the corrosion holding the fastener on! This makes it easier to remove!",

These tools focus on a power and fast rotational hammering action to shock and loosen the bolt in one motion! They are much less likely to round off a bolt then using a breaker bar! However, They tend to occasionally snap rusty bolts off unfortunately. Use with care, Especially if you have a powerful one! There is not much to them, Simply put them on a rusty nut and depress the trigger and let the tool hammer away! These are all methods I’ve used personally and have found work for me, I hope this has helped make the frustration and difficulty of stuck nuts and bolts a thing of the past for you.",

I posted this tech review on myblogbut wanted to share it with those of you who may be on the fence about the Icom radios. I would definitely recommend this radio over the RDU and RDV series by Motorola. Icom IC-F4001 | IC-F3001 Radio: What’s Inside, Disassembly, and Tech Review Only a little more than a year ago Icom America, Inc. released a new, easy to use, portable radio in the business industry and commercial market. The Icom IC-F4001 (UHF) or F3001 (VHF) is similar to it’s siblings, most notably the Icom F4011/3011 but with a few exceptions.",

Add on a Lithium Ion battery and low-profile antenna and you have yourself a winner! Lookout BPR40, TK3302, and CP200 there are waves being made! With any new radio I like to take a look at what’s “under the hood” since beauty doesn’t mean much when we are talking about two-way radios. A dependable, quality crafted radio is what both business and public safety industries rely on to carry out daily operations. These users need rugged, reliable equipment that puts function first, and form second (yet not forgotten). So let’s take a look inside this Icom portable radio!",

I have seen many RDX radios with broken arms or not making good contact with the speaker which causes intermittent audio. On the top is the rubber grommet which prevents water and debris from entering the radio through the top selector knobs or antenna shaft: Soldier connections look solid and circuit board is cleanly laid out. Here is one of my pet peeves!! The other common issue I find on Motorola CP110 and RDX radios is the soldier joints on the PTT button-they break off all the time!

Since it's synthetic, it doesn't gum up at all. Watches can run well past the life span of synthetic oils. When we use animal/vegetable oil, the lubricant eventually gums up due to natural occurring substances. On the other hand, synthetic oil literally dries up and evaporates. This leaves the pivots running dry on the jewels which will cause added friction and wear on the pivots.

Epilame alters the surface tension of whatever you’re applying it to so that oil will likely remain in place. We’ll want to use Epilame because modern watches are running at such high speeds that oil is likely to either flick away or spread around. Take a look at the link in my bio for more info. We use epilame on common parts with extremely high transitional force such as the escape wheel and pallet fork jewels. We will also use it on the second wheel pivot at the end and balance cap jewels. At the manufacture level, they will have epilame’d a good majority of the movement. Outside of that, the movement does not require another epilame treatment. ______",

You can install rivets by drilling or punching a hole in the job material. Next, place the rivet and deform the tail. The simplest way is to bore a hole in the material of the components to connect, because it’s quicker and easier to accomplish. To get the desired fastening, the diameter of the drilled hole should be about 1.5 times larger than the rivet diameter. After insertion, the tail emerges from the opposite end, and you can twist it. When you hammer or apply force to the flat side of the tail, the material flattens to about 1½ times its original size.",

Structural blind rivets and multi-grip lockbolt systems are vital components used in this industry. There are many uses for blind rivets in trucks — including tractors and their trailers, as well as heavy-duty pickups. This is by necessity: while cars can be quite heavy and difficult to disassemble for a task like riveting, trucks are even more so. For instance, many semi-trucks need large metal panels to hold the truck exterior together. When you need to assemble them and the other side is inaccessible, blind riveting can do the trick, while also providing excellent durability.",

Excess single-part epoxy is easier to remove in its uncured state – after it has been through an oven, it is extremely tough and hard to remove.

Contamination levels may vary. Excessive contamination and using an adhesive which is not oil tolerant will reduce the strength and overall success of a bonded assembly. Please speak to Henkel's technical team for information and guidance. Unplanned downtime or lower plant productivity can prevent you from achieving the manufacturing excellence that you are looking for. Consult with our experts to find ways to make your machine more reliable and reduce unplanned downtime to save costs.",

With the rising need for sustainable practices such as recycling and reusing materials across diverse end-use industry applications, the need tode-bond materials, components, and parts is paramount. Furthermore, temporary disassembly of components for maintenance and repair using damage-free and less tedious disassembly processes is also a growing trend.

Whoever decided to include them in these iMacs deserves to be held upside down by their toenails, because it basically turned every single device from this era into near-instant e-waste.

After about an hour of disassembly, I got to this point – the fan and power supply are out, but I was now held up by two tiny screws that, frustratingly, I didn’t have drivers for.

But after that… it’s actually not substantially different to before. The same sorts of peaks – maybe a little bit higher lower baseline? Here’s the same graph just showing the past 7 days – that peak of 100 watts was nice and short. Otherwise, it seems basically no different. Swapping out a HDD for an SSD with no moving parts might also have saved some power as well. Perhaps that’s enough to offset the RAM increase… hard to say for certain. There’s one last factor that I consider for how it might affect whether the upgrade increases (or decreases) my device’s energy consumption – that’s what it does to my usage patterns.",

Dowel pins (and pin-slot arrangements) are often the go-to for precision alignment. However, one side of the dowel connection requires a slip/clearance fit while the other side requires a press fit. Due to the potential clearance in the slip fit this setup might not be as accurate as using another method. The method I use most frequently is just using the outside surface of a circular part to fit into a large hole on the other part. However, this is usually a sliding fit or even a locational clearance fit, where the potential clearance could allow the parts to sit off-centre.",

Effective: The connection strength of snap-fits can meet most product design requirements. In products requiring higher connection strength, snap-fits can be used as an auxiliary connection along with screws.

Or tried to push a rubber hose onto a pipe only to find it wouldn’t slide into place because the fit was just too tight? These tasks can be very frustrating and can often require considerable physical effort and time. Rubber materials are inherently difficult to install, remove, or otherwise manipulate – even when wet.

Increase Production Rates:Applying an assembly lubricant to the rubber part makes the rubber slippery, so parts can easily slide into place. After the lubricant dries, the lubricity goes away and mated parts maintain a tight fit. The assembly process becomes more productive because it is easier and quicker. 5. Help to Avoid Worker Injuries:Lubricants reduce the insertion force needed for rubber assembly. Workers can more easily push parts into place, reducing the amount of musculoskeletal, slippage, and repetitive stress related injuries that can be caused by using too much force to insert a rubber part.",

    "text": "The primary objective of our study is to prevent the increase in plastic deformation at the shaft-hub interface during disassembly, which is crucial to prevent damage to the parts. To facilitate disassembly through thermal expansion, even heating was applied to the hub. This approach is similar to shrink fitting, where a transient heat is applied to the hub during assembly, causing it to shrink while cooling after assembly. Since the hub has a significantly larger surface area than the pin, the expansion of the hub would have a greater effect. To simulate heat transfer during disassembly, a transient thermal analysis was performed with our model.",

The initial temperature was maintained at 22 C, and a displacement of 4.5 millimeters was applied to the shaft. We kept the temperature of the parts under 300 C, since both the yield strength and Young’s modulus of S235 steel decrease at higher temperatures. We then determined the plastic strain, contact pressure and disassembly force resulting from the transient thermal analysis. Being a mild steel, S235 is vulnerable to uniform corrosion when exposed to humid air. Therefore, we used a COF of 0.6 for our analysis.",

When those parameters were increased to 5,000 newtons and 1,500 hertz, the breaking force was slightly less, about 24.6 kilonewtons.

However, tolerance is the acceptable deviation from the nominal dimensions or base measurement in engineering fit. Tolerance in press fit ensures the components of an assembly match the specified functional requirements without jeopardizing the joint’s integrity. Unlike transition fit and clearance fit, interference fit forms a permanent coupling of two components. These friction fits (press fit) require light or large forces depending on factors like material properties.

Press fit is a mechanical assembly method that uses pressure to tightly fit parts of slightly different sizes to achieve a secure connection.

Press fit is a standard mechanical assembly method that applies pressure to insert one part into the hole or sleeve of another part so that they fit tightly together.

Additionally, rounding stress concentration corners, adding material to the back to convert through-holes to blind holes, or adding reinforcement ribs can enhance strength. By understanding and utilizing these elements effectively, product designers can optimize snap-fit connections for various applications. Plastic snap-fits can be classified based on the difficulty of disassembly into detachable snap-fits (live snaps) and non-detachable snap-fits (dead snaps). Detachable snap-fits can further be divided into easily detachable snap-fits and difficult-to-detach snap-fits.",

Plastic snap-fit connections primarily utilize the elastic deformation and recovery properties of plastic materials.

Thus, it is not solely about the amount of engagement. Some snap-fits may have a small engagement but are difficult or impossible to disassemble due to limited deformation space.",

Whether mechanically cut or directly printed, additively manufactured parts with functional threads can be integrated into larger systems with ease, adding value to products and strengthening production streams. A second method is to mechanically cut the threads into the plastic part. This is done using a pilot hole to guide the location in the part.

    "text": "An L-shaped snap-fit provides lateral support, locking parts together through a side-locking mechanism. Unlike cantilever snap-fits, which engage along a vertical axis, L-shaped snap-fits secure parts by applying pressure along a horizontal axis, making them ideal for side-locking applications. An annular snap-fit forms a circular or ring-shaped joint that locks into place, providing 360° engagement around the part, typically seen in cylindrical components. Proper tolerances are critical to snap-fit functionality, especially in injection moulding and 3D printing. Below are general tolerance guidelines: Choosing the correct snap-fit joint involves understanding the application environment, load-bearing requirements, and suitable materials.",

    "text": "Doing so results in a more balanced strain distribution and producing cost-effective snap-fit components by using less material. The goal of utilizing this approach is to strengthen snap-fit designs. Achieving the desired stiffness level for snap-fit components may require some experimentation. To ensure optimal part stiffness, it is advisable to utilize a clip with a minimum width of 5mm. It’s good practice to add lungs into your snap-fit designs. Incorporating lugs into your snap-fit components can aid in alignment and alleviate the shear loads that your snap-fit clips will experience. It is not recommended to create snap-fit joints vertically upwards from the bed during 3D printing, as they may weaken due to the anisotropic nature of the process.",

Operators can detect failure patterns in an injection mold early enough to avoid injection mold repair or replacement costs and losses due to a lack of production.

L‑PBF complies with high performance requirements, is suitable for small lot sizes and stands for high cost tolerances (compared to other metal AM methods).

The cavitation effect of ultrasound in the liquid also inhibits the corrosion process, contributing to surface brightening. Fluid polishing uses high-speed flowing liquid-carrying abrasives to polish the workpiece surface. Common methods include abrasive jet machining, liquid jet machining, and fluid dynamic grinding. In fluid dynamic grinding, a hydraulically driven medium containing abrasive particles flows rapidly back and forth over the workpiece surface. The medium typically consists of special compounds (polymer-like substances) mixed with abrasives, such as silicon carbide powder.",

When using 8000# polishing paste, the usual load is 100-200g/cm², but maintaining this load precisely is difficult. To facilitate this, a thin and narrow handle can be made on a wooden strip, or part of a bamboo strip can be cut to make it more flexible. This helps control the polishing pressure, ensuring the mold surface pressure is not too high. When using diamond polishing, not only must the work surface be clean, but the worker’s hands must also be very clean. Polishing plastic molds is quite different from the surface polishing required in other industries.",

The shape of the grinding tools should closely match the surface shape of the mold to ensure the workpiece does not get deformed during grinding. The biggest issue encountered in daily polishing is “over-polishing,” where the longer the polishing time, the worse the surface quality of the mold. Over-polishing manifests in two phenomena: “orange peel” and “pitting.” Over-polishing commonly occurs during mechanical polishing. Irregularly rough surfaces are referred to as “orange peel.” There are many causes of orange peel, with the most common being mold surface overheating or excessive carburization. Excessive polishing pressure and prolonged polishing time are the main reasons for orange peel.",

Harder steels can withstand more polishing pressure, while relatively softer steels are prone to over-polishing. Research has shown that the time for over-polishing varies with the hardness of the steel. When poor surface quality is detected, many people increase the polishing pressure and extend the polishing time, which often worsens the surface quality. Non-metallic impurities in the steel, usually hard and brittle oxides, are pulled out from the steel surface during polishing, forming micro-pits or pitting. The main factors causing pitting are: 1) Excessive polishing pressure and prolonged polishing time. 2) Insufficient purity of the steel, high content of hard impurities. 3) Rust on the mold surface.",

TLDR: Business is slow, no one wants to fix their device sayings its to expensive (When they have a $1000 device in their hand). I blame the big guys, \"trade in and get blah blah blah\". Customers think $60 is to much, rather get a new one. Tried to offer deals, still to expensive. Im even surprised if the mechanics shops are having it worse.

We reached out to Apple for comment, but they did not reply. It’s hard to believe, after years of repair-blocking issues withTouch ID,batteries, andcameras, that Apple’s latest iPhone part lock-out isaccidental.

Proper welding repair requires specialized skills, knowledge, and equipment to ensure the welding repair is performed accordingly. In this article, we will cover the fundamentals, techniques, and process of welding repair. Welding repairis a commonly used method where the damaged material is eliminated through arc gouging and then the element is welded to reconnect the material on either side of the crack. By exposing both sides to high-temperature heat until they reach their melting point making a strong and robust bond.",

Stick welding or SMAW is a welding process where a consumable electrode coated with a flux that melts and provides a gas shield during welding is used. This welding process is versatile and can be utilized to weld different types of metals and alloys. TIG welding or Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) is a welding process where a non-consumable tungsten electrode is utilized to create the weld. It usually requires a separate filler metal to join the two metal parts.
